Project from [The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#assignment). 

Initially the project asked to turn a white square black when the mouse hovers over the square, but I did the extra credit challenge by adding a random rgb color to each mouse over. Also I made it so that if a square has already been mouse overed you can't change it's color.
